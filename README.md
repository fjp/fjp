### Hi there, I'm Franz 👋

- 👨‍💻 I'm a software engineer at [Leica Geosystems AG](https://leica-geosystems.com/) (part of [Hexagon](https://hexagon.com/)), where I develop software for high-end 3D laser scanners.
- 🔬 Previously, I worked on deep learning–based machine vision systems at [Oculytics](https://oculytics.com/).
- 🚘 I’ve contributed to trajectory planning and autonomous driving algorithm development.
- 🏡 I recently finished building a smart home powered by the KNX bus system — check out the [home automation project](https://fjp.at/projects/home-automation/).
- 🤖 In my free time, I work on ROS-based robotics projects:
